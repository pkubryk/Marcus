# No Documentation Creation

Do not create summary documents, cleanup reports, or other documentation files unless explicitly requested by the user. Focus on the actual work requested without generating additional documentation.

When completing tasks:
- Execute the requested changes
- Provide brief status updates
- Do not create markdown files to document what was done
- Keep responses concise and action-focused
