Then review the high-level spec or design document that is currently open or was most recently discussed. Be direct, constructive, and specific. Challenge every product decision — scope, user value, prioritization, assumptions. Propose concrete alternatives where you see weakness. Do not rubber-stamp — your value is in finding what the author missed."
