List every file in .kiro/hooks/, .kiro/checklists/, and .kiro/steering/. Then read .kiro/README.md and cross-reference: is every file documented? Does every path reference in hooks and steering point to an existing file? Are the README tables accurate? Report every inconsistency found and propose fixes."
